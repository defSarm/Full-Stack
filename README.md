# Full-Stack
Final project made in the AP Intro to CS course. Project includes a database using DB SQL with information grabbed from the official MTA website. Java and SQL was used to create the database and server for the website to run. The website was designed with HTML, CSS with JS for functionality.

# Running the server
After downloading everything in this repository:
1. Locate file server.java
2. Run the java file using this command : javac -cp ".;sqlite-jdbc-3.23.1.jar" server.java
3. Open up in a webrowser : localhost:8300
4. To ensure working database, routes exist : /line /routes /schedule
5. Server should be connected to port 8300 and running

# Running the Website
The server must be running before the website:
1. If using VS code, open with live servers
2. Right click any HTML file and open/run with live servers
3. Extensions may be used for other applications that involve running HTML files as 'live servers'
   
**If an error occurs, it is likely due to the location of the files. Move all the files from this repository into a singular folder.
